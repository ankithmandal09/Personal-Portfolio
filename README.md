### How to Set It Up Locally:

#### **Prerequisites**:
- Tools: Text editor VS Code, Git, Node.js.
- Environment: Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### **Setup Steps**:
1.Clone the Repository: 
- Begin by cloning the project repository to your local system. Use a Git client or run the command git clone <repository_url> in your terminal. Once cloned, navigate to the project folder using cd <repository_folder_name>.

2.Install Dependencies: 
- If the portfolio is built using a framework like React, Angular, or any other library that requires a build process, ensure Node.js is installed on your system. Inside the project folder, run the command npm install to install all required dependencies.

3.Run the Project Locally:
- For a static portfolio, open the index.html file directly in your browser. If the portfolio uses a development server (e.g., React or Next.js), start the server by running npm start in the terminal. This will open the project in your default browser on a local development server.

4.Customize Content:
- Open the project files in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code). Edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed to update the text, images, and styles to match your personal branding.

5.View and Test Changes: 
- Save your edits and refresh your browser to view updates. For dynamic changes, use a live server or the framework’s hot reload feature to test the functionality instantly.



## **Installation Instructions**  

- Git: For cloning the repository.
- Node.js (if using a javascript framework): For installing dependencies.
- Text Editor: VS Code.
